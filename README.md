- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @alexanderkjackson-protonmail-com
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in ...
-    *Containers (both system and app)
-  *Isolation (namespacing, seccomp. and shim preloading)
-  *BPF applications (eBPF for full-system observability)
-  *ZFS (best file system)
-  *Artificial intelligence (mostly language and tech related, e.g. code completers, extractive Q&A)

-  Languages:
-  1. Python
   2. C (*not* CPP)

   4. Rust (I actually have to learn this one still)
